    <h3>DECLARATION IN SUPPORT OF PETITION FOR DISMISSAL</h3>
    <p style="font-size: 12px;">Case No. FSB2021CR00456</p>
  </div>

  <div class="section">
    <p>I, <strong>JOHN MICHAEL DOE</strong>, declare under penalty of perjury:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Personal Background:</strong><br>
      I am 35 years old, born on January 15, 1989, in San Bernardino, California. I have resided in San Bernardino County for my entire life. I graduated from San Bernardino High School in 2007 and have two children, ages 8 and 6, whom I support as a single parent.</li>

      <li style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Circumstances of the Offense:</strong><br>
      On January 10, 2021, I was arrested for possession of methamphetamine. At that time, I was struggling with addiction following a workplace injury that left me unable to work and in chronic pain. I began using drugs to cope with both physical pain and depression. I take full responsibility for my actions and understand the seriousness of my offense.</li>

      <li style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Acceptance of Responsibility:</strong><br>
      I pleaded guilty on March 15, 2021, accepting full responsibility for my actions. I have never minimized or denied my wrongdoing. This experience served as a wake-up call that changed my life.</li>

      <li style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Rehabilitation Efforts:</strong><br>
      Since my conviction, I have undertaken substantial efforts to rehabilitate myself:
        <ul>
          <li>‚Ä¢ Completed 6-month intensive outpatient treatment at New Hope Recovery Center</li>
          <li>‚Ä¢ Attended Narcotics Anonymous meetings 3x weekly for 3+ years (sponsor letter attached)</li>
          <li>‚Ä¢ Completed anger management course (certificate attached)</li>
          <li>‚Ä¢ Completed parenting classes through Family Services Agency</li>
          <li>‚Ä¢ Underwent individual counseling for 18 months</li>
          <li>‚Ä¢ Passed 36 consecutive drug tests during probation</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Current Employment and Education:</strong><br>
      I have been employed at ABC Logistics since June 2022. I started as a warehouse worker and was promoted to shift supervisor in January 2023, then to warehouse supervisor in August 2024. My employer is aware of my conviction and has provided a letter of support. I am also attending San Bernardino Valley College part-time, pursuing an Associate's Degree in Business Management (currently have 24 units completed with a 3.4 GPA).</li>

      <li style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Community Involvement:</strong><br>
      I volunteer regularly at:
        <ul>
          <li>‚Ä¢ San Bernardino Rescue Mission (10 hours monthly)</li>
          <li>‚Ä¢ Youth basketball coach at YMCA</li>
          <li>‚Ä¢ School reading program at my children's elementary school</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Family Responsibilities:</strong><br>
      As a single parent, I am the sole provider for my two children. I maintain stable housing, ensure they attend school regularly, and am actively involved in their education and activities. My conviction limits my ability to volunteer for certain school functions and field trips.</li>

      <li style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Future Goals:</strong><br>
      My goals include:
        <ul>
          <li>‚Ä¢ Complete my Associate's Degree by 2025</li>
          <li>‚Ä¢ Obtain promotion to Operations Manager</li>
          <li>‚Ä¢ Purchase a home for my family</li>
          <li>‚Ä¢ Start a nonprofit to help others struggling with addiction</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Impact of Conviction:</strong><br>
      The conviction has prevented me from:
        <ul>
          <li>‚Ä¢ Obtaining professional licenses</li>
          <li>‚Ä¢ Qualifying for certain housing</li>
          <li>‚Ä¢ Advancing in my career</li>
          <li>‚Ä¢ Fully participating in my children's school activities</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Support System:</strong><br>
      I have built a strong support network including my NA sponsor (5 years clean), my employer, my pastor, and my family. Letters of support are attached from each of these individuals.</li>
    </ol>

    <p style="margin-top: 30px;">I respectfully request that the Court grant my petition for dismissal. I have learned from my mistakes, taken responsibility for my actions, and worked hard to become a productive member of society. I am committed to continuing on this positive path.</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 30px;">I declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.</p>

    <h4>II. LEGAL AUTHORITY</h4>
    <p><strong>A. Statutory Authority</strong></p>
    <p>Penal Code ¬ß 1203.4(a)(1) provides:</p>
    <blockquote style="margin-left: 20px; font-style: italic;">
      "In any case in which a defendant has fulfilled the conditions of probation for the entire period of probation... the defendant shall, at any time after the termination of the period of probation... be permitted by the court to withdraw his or her plea of guilty... and... the court shall thereupon dismiss the accusations or information against the defendant..."

      <li>Not on probation for any offense (PC ¬ß 1203.4(a)(1))</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>III. INTERESTS OF JUSTICE STANDARD</h4>
    <p>Courts have broad discretion in determining whether dismissal is in the interests of justice. <em>People v. McLernon</em> (2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 569, 576. Factors include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Nature and severity of the offense</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Defendant's criminal history</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Defendant's rehabilitation efforts</li>
      <li>‚Ä¢ Impact on defendant's livelihood</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>IV. ARGUMENT</h4>
    <p>The interests of justice strongly favor granting this petition:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Complete Rehabilitation:</strong> Petitioner has maintained sobriety for 3+ years, completed treatment, and transformed his life.</li>
      <li><strong>Productive Member of Society:</strong> Steady employment, pursuing education, supporting family.</li>
      <li><strong>No Public Safety Risk:</strong> No arrests or violations since conviction.</li>
      <li><strong>Compelling Need:</strong> Conviction limits employment and housing opportunities.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>V. CONCLUSION</h4>
    <p>For the foregoing reasons, Petitioner respectfully requests the Court grant this petition and dismiss the conviction pursuant to Penal Code ¬ß 1203.4.</p>
